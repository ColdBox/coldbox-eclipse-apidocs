<h2 id="WhatisColdBox">What is ColdBox?</h2>
<p>
ColdBox is an event-driven conventions based ColdFusion Framework. It
provides you with a set of reusable code and tools that you can use to
increase your productivity, and it provides you with a development
standard when working in a team environment. It makes use of an MVC
(Model View Controller) design pattern and an extensive array of
patterns for its operations such as Factories, Helpers, Workers, etc.
And since it is based on CFCs it does not rely on an XML dialect.
However, ColdBox is not only an MVC framework, but a software toolkit
and a remote event-driven framework. Making it a robust application
development platform, The ColdBox Platform.

<p>In this article you will have an overview of the main components of
this Object Oriented Framework. Below are some good resources for you
to read about design patterns and some object orientation goodness.
Having some basic object oriented knowledge will help you tremendously
during your initial stages of ColdBox development. However, if you are
not an OO guru, no worries, the guides contained in this wiki will help
you and take you to several learning paths of object orientation and
software development. This is just an introductory guide, so you might
encounter new terminology or features of the framework that you might
have no clue about. I urge you to continue reading the guides in order
to find a cohesive outlook of what is ColdBox

</p>
<h2 id="WhataresomeofColdBoxsNovelFeatures">What are some of ColdBox's Novel Features</h2>
<h3 id="Documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>We are firm believers in developer education. We have over 30 step
by step guides and over 550 pages worth of documentation right in this
wiki. We believe that by empowering the user with knowledge, the
adaptation rate will increase and the ability of the developer to find
what they need will make their productivity increase. </p>
<h3 id="CustomConventions">Custom Conventions</h3>
<p>
Conventions over configurations is our motto.  We get rid of verbosity of xml logic and use <a class="missing wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/ColdFusion" rel="nofollow">ColdFusion?</a>
and a set of conventions for our applications. With ColdBox you can
even define your own application layouts and conventions. This gives
great flexibility to developers who are used to their own application
layouts and conventions. Conventions are also used for registering
events, interceptors, plugins and much more. The use of conventions
over configurations is what makes ColdBox unique.
</p>
<h3 id="ColdfusionControllersinsteadofXMLControllers">Coldfusion Controllers instead of XML Controllers</h3>
<p>ColdBox doesn't rely on xml declarative logic where you have to
define an event, what it does and where does it go. ColdBox is a
conventions based framework that will let you program in ColdFusion to
get things done. You basically expose methods on event handler CFC's
(Controllers) by turning their access to public or remote. The
framework then will auto-register the handler CFC's and now you are
able to use the methods as ColdBox Events. So the declarative logic is
now placed within the methods, where you can place method exit points,
what business logic to call and what view to render or what event to
surrender execution to or whatever you like, in CODE. This is how
ColdBox can help you create multi-layered applications with one single
skeleton and configuration file. So instead of working with a long and
complex configuration file all the time, you are mostly working with
ColdFusion code all the time. You would use the configuration file to
setup your project or maybe tweak some settings.
</p>
<h3 id="Aspectprogramming">Aspect programming</h3>
<p>ColdBox comes bundled with an extensive set of plugins and
interceptors that will help you on every day software application tasks
like bug reports and notifications, AOP file logging with
auto-archiving, per-environment settings, storage facilities for
cluster environments, object caching, datasource declarations, web
services integrations, internationalization, IoC integrations,
application security, pretty URL's via SES and so much more. ColdBox is
not only an MVC framework but a development platform.
</p>
<h3 id="ColdBoxDashboard">ColdBox Dashboard</h3>
<p>The ColdBox Dashboard is a visual application that helps you
configure your framework installation and has tools for code
generation. It is also a self-documenting application that will help
you learn about the framework. You can modify all of the framework
configurations, read documentation and it is tightly integrated to this
site for you to search the wiki, svn repository, and ticket reports,
and much more. <i>(Different License than The ColdBox Framework)</i>
</p>
<h3 id="ColdBoxCaching">ColdBox Caching</h3>
<p>
ColdBox has an advanced memory aware and configurable caching engine.
You have several tuning parameters for the cache and also visual cache
reports in the debugging panel. You can actually see how many objects
and what type of objects are in your cache, the efficiency of your
cache and the tuning parameters. This feature will help developers save
time and actually not have to worry about persistence. ColdBox also
allows for event caching, in which the HTML output events produce will
be cached by the framework and presented to users. This will enhance
applications and system stability. The best part of it is that you use
metadata in the cfcomponent and cffunction tags to actually declare
caching parameters. ColdBox also allows for extensive view caching and
on-demand render and cache capabilities. To top it off, the caching
engine has an event broadcaster model built-in that can advice you off
new objects and object removals.
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Overview_files/cachemonitor.png" style="border: 1px outset rgb(234, 234, 234);">
</div>
<h3 id="UnitTesting">Unit Testing</h3>
<p>ColdBox is a framework based on objects and Unit Testing is an
integral part of development, then why shouldn't you be able to unit
test your handlers and provide you with integration testing? Well, Unit
Testing is part of ColdBox. ColdBox includes a unit testing feature to
let you do integration testing and test the entire application by
testing your event handlers. You can event test relocations and
re-routing.
</p>
<h3 id="ColdBoxProxy:FlexAirRemoteIntegration">ColdBox Proxy: Flex/Air/Remote Integration</h3>
<p>The ColdBox proxy enables remote applications like Flex and AIR to
communicate with ColdBox and provide an event model for those
applications. Not only that, but you can reinitialize the entire
application, get settings, and yes, announce custom or core
interceptions. You can create custom interceptor chains for your model
that can be executed asynchronously when a user hits a save record
button for example. You can create a Service Layer with built-in
environmental settings, logging, error handling, event interception and
chaining, you name it, and the possibilities are endless.
</p>
<p>Not only that, but this enables you to actually create any amount of
front ends using the same reusable ColdBox and model code. The code is
the same, you create event handlers, you interact with a request
collection, with core and custom plugins, but you don't set views or
layouts because the framework is now a remote framework for your model.
So what do you do, well, return data, arrays, xml, and value objects.
Anything, right from within the event handlers or setup a configuration
setting that tells the framework to always return the request
collection.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="Overview_files/coldboxproxy_overview.png" style="border: 1px outset rgb(234, 234, 234);"></div>
<h2 id="HowColdBoxWorks">How ColdBox Works?</h2>
<p>ColdBox uses both implicit and explicit invocation methods to
execute events and render content; ColdBox is an event driven
framework. You have one single xml configuration file: <i>coldbox.xml.cfm</i>, from where you can configure your entire application (No logic, just configuration data).  You can use <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.coldspringframework.org/"><span class="icon">ColdSpring</span></a>, <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/"><span class="icon">Transfer</span></a>,
Remoting, CRUD, Bean/DAO Factories or any other technology and/or
pattern that you can think off with ColdBox. However, ColdBox does make
you adhere to an application <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbDirectoryStructure">directory structure</a>
based on conventions that are fully customizable. This is done with the
purpose of creating a standard for all developers in the same team to
share and for ColdBox to find what it needs. Remember that this
framework will not solve your problems. It is a standard, a foundation
on which to develop on and thanks to its software programming aspects
that it provides, this framework can also be a development toolkit.
However, it is up to you to create GOOD code, this is not a magical
framework that will make your code better. It will help you, but at the
end of the day, it is your responsibility.
</p>
<p>ColdBox makes use of the Front Controller design pattern as its
means of operation while in MVC mode. This means that every request
comes in through a single template, usually <strong>index.cfm</strong>.
Once a request is received by the framework through this front
controller, it will parse the request and re-direct appropriately to
the correct execution paths. The way events are detected are via a
URL/FORM or remote variable named by default <strong>event</strong> or
by using the default SES routing techniques in ColdBox. This event
variable holds a specific pattern that lets the framework know what to
execute. This is called ColdBox event syntax:
</p>
<p>
<strong>NON SES MODE</strong>
<i>[handler|package].[action]</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>SES MODE</strong>
<i>/index.cfm/{package}/{handler}/{action}</i>
</p>
<p>The handler is the name of the event handler CFC and the action is
the name of the public or remote method to execute. You can also
pre-pend package names (directories) of where event handlers can be
found. Please note that our recommendation is to use SES routing so you
can create meaningful URI's and abstract out the real names of the
handlers and locations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You are only limited by your ingenuity
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ImplicitExplicitInvocations">Implicit &amp; Explicit Invocations</h2>
<p>ColdBox Events can be registered for execution in two different
ways. Events can be registered for the following events via the
configuration file, which are run implicitly (No need for you to call
them):
</p>
<ul><li>Request Start Handler (simulates onRequestStart)
</li><li>Request End Handler (simulates onRequestEnd)
</li><li>Application Start Handler (simulates onApplicationStart)
</li><li>Session Start Handler (simulates onSessionStart)
</li><li>Session End Handler (simulates onSessionEnd)
</li><li>defaultEvent (The default event to execute)
</li><li>onException (The event to execute when an exception occurs)
</li><li>onInvalidEvent (The event to execute when an invalid event is detected)
</li></ul><p>There are also some more implicit convention method
declarations that can be executed by just writing the following methods
inside of a handler CFC:
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tbody><tr><td> <strong>preHandler</strong>  </td><td> Executes before the requested event (In the same handler CFC) 
</td></tr><tr><td> <strong>postHandler</strong> </td><td> Executes after the requested event (In the same handler CFC) 
</td></tr><tr><td> <strong>onMissingAction</strong> </td><td> Executes if an action was requested from this handler but the method does not exist (In the same handler CFC) 
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
   
The other method to execute events is via explicit declarations from within your code using the <strong>runEvent()</strong>
method. From these events, you declare what business actions to invoke,
what view to render, call/use plugins, and if more events need to be
executed (chaining). All these actions are done explicitly, you define
them in CF code and <strong>not in XML Dialect</strong>.  The ColdBox controller then implicitly renders layouts/views that were set by the event handlers and finalizes execution.
</p>
<p>
One thing to note, is that the event handler's events (<i>methods</i>)
are very loosely coupled to each other. They interact on their own and
do what they need to do and surrender execution to the framework. As
you can see, due to the nature of event handlers written in ColdFusion,
you have explicit declarations that would otherwise be implicit if done
in an XML based dialect. Thus, the cohesion between implicit and
explicit event executions can exist in a ColdBox application. At the
end of the day, ColdBox is based on events and cannot function without
them.
</p>
<p>
Below is a quote by Oscar Arevalo concerning ColdBox's functionality:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ColdBox takes a more direct approach to determine what gets called
and when; yes, this adds some coupling between the views and the event
handlers, but the benefit is that the amount of indirection and
obfuscation is reduced; resulting in what I think is one of the biggest
benefits of ColdBox: that you actually program in coldfusion, and not
in some XML dialect. This results in applications that are very easy to
follow, even if the framework is not there." by <strong>Oscar Arevalo</strong>

<h2 id="Therequestlifecycle">The request lifecycle</h2>
<p>
Please see the <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbRequestLifecycle">application life cycle guide</a> to understand the basics of <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/ColdBox">ColdBox</a>'s request life cycles.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h2 id="ConfigurationFilecoldbox.xml">Configuration File (coldbox.xml)</h2>
<p>
ColdBox is configured for operation via a single xml file. You can
define the major settings for your application, what features to use,
etc. You need to read the following guide to understand much better the
possibilities with ColdBox
</p>
<ul><li><a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbConfigGuide">Configuration Guide</a>
</li><li><a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbSettingsGuide">Settings Guide</a>
</li></ul><h2 id="EventHandlersControllers">Event Handlers (Controllers)</h2>
<p>
ColdBox Event handlers are CFC's that act as your application controllers. Most of this topic is covered in the <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbEventHandlersGuide">Event Handlers Guide</a>. Here is a brief introduction:
</p>
<ul><li>First of all, these CFC's must extend the coldbox eventhandler base CFC: <strong>coldbox.system.eventhandler</strong>
</li><li>If they implement an <strong>init</strong> method, then they must call the base class constructor using the <strong>super</strong>
method. Remember that if you implement an init method in an event
handler. All the methods executed from this handler will run the
constructor code.
</li><li>The CFC's must be placed in the <strong>handlers</strong> directory under your application (Conventions). See <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbDirectoryStructure">cbDirectoryStructure</a>
</li><li>Then you need to create methods that will respond to events. ColdBox uses the <strong>event</strong> action variable on form submits and url parameters to determine what event to execute.  
</li><li>Handlers will be cached by the framework and cache metadata can be attached to their cfcomponent declaration.
</li></ul><p>
The format of this event variable is <strong>{package}.{event_handler CFC}.{method}</strong>
</p>
<p>The framework on initialization will read your handler directory and
register the available handlers. Once an event is detected to execute,
the framework will validate both the handler and the method. Therefore,
in order to expose an event to the framework, just create a method in
your CFC with public or remote access.
</p>
<p>Event handlers can also be called from remote applications such as
Ajax and Flex via the ColdBox Proxy. You can even determine if an
incoming request is an MVC or Remote request and react accordingly. In
remote mode, your event handlers can actually return data.
</p>
<h2 id="RequestCollection">Request Collection</h2>
<p>ColdBox also uses a request collection data structure where all
variables can be stored and shared among an execution request. The
Request Collection is a central repository of information that is
refreshed on every user request with the request's information. This is
how data gets moved around from event handlers to views and layouts to
plugins and anything running inside of the framework and in the MVC
layers. The object containing the request collection is the request
context object found at coldbox.system.beans.requestContext.(<a href="http://www.coldboxframework.com/api">See ColdBox API</a>).
Not only can you use the request context object but you can decorate
it! You can expand its functionality according to your needs with the
introduction of ColdBox 2.5.0, please read the <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbRequestContextDecoratorGuide">Request Context Decorator Guide</a>
to help you learn more. The request context is not a mere data
structure where you get and set values, but an object that is used to
set views or layouts for rendering, caching views, getting event
metadata, determining what is being executed and so much more.
</p>
<h2 id="Plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p>Another important ColdBox feature is the use of a plugin library of
CFC's that extend the normal usage of ColdBox to application specific
tasks but without hindering system performance. These plugins are
reusable components that your applications can use and can be loaded on
demand via the ColdBox Plugin Factory. Some samples are: i18n, resource
bundles, refresh a webservice stub, Bug Reports, java file utilities,
etc. This is a major difference between ColdBox and any other
framework, in that it gives you a set of reusable on-demand components
for tedious or repeatable application-specific tasks. Thus, the toolkit
aspect of ColdBox.
</p>
<p>
Also, not only can you use and modify the plugins that come with every ColdBox installation, <strong>but you can create your own</strong>.
You are not limited anymore, you can extend the framework to your
needs. You can create as many plugins as you want and build a plugins
library that can be located by just specifying it on the configuration
file or loaded up via conventions. You will then be able to get the
plugin and use it on any of your ColdBox applications. The best part of
it all, is that the plugin will inherit all of the framework's
functionality, so you have everything that you need to be able to code.
</p>
<p>
How easy is it? well, you just do the following:
</p>
<ul><li>Make your plugin CFC extend <strong>coldbox.system.plugin</strong>
</li><li>Create an init method with the following standard code:
</li></ul><div class="code"><pre><span class="h_tag">&lt;cffunction</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">name</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"init"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">access</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"public"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">returntype</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"coldbox.system.plugin"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">output</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"false"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">cache</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"{true or false}"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">cachetimeout</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"{x in minutes}"</span><span class="h_tag">&gt;</span>
        <span class="h_tag">&lt;cfargument</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">name</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"controller"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">type</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"any"</span><span class="h_other"> </span><span class="h_attribute">required</span><span class="h_other">=</span><span class="h_doublestring">"true"</span><span class="h_tag">&gt;</span>
        <span class="h_tag">&lt;cfscript&gt;</span>
        //Set controller reference
        super.Init(arguments.controller);
        //Plugin Name
        setpluginName("Name of the plugin");
        //Version of the plugin
        setpluginVersion("1.0");
        //Small description
        setpluginDescription("I am a simple bean factory");
        return this;
        <span class="h_tag">&lt;/cfscript&gt;</span>
<span class="h_tag">&lt;/cffunction&gt;</span>
</pre></div><ul><li>Create your methods and WALLAH!!! You are done and you can call any of the inherited methods from coldbox.system.plugin.cfc
</li><li>You can also declare caching metadata in the cfcomponent declaration, so ColdBox will persist your plugins.
</li></ul><p>
<strong>Please see the <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbMyFirstPlugin">Creating My First Plugin Guide</a> for more information</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="Interceptors">Interceptors</h2>
<p>ColdBox interceptors increase functionality for applications and
framework alike, without touching the core functionality, and thus
encapsulating logic into separate objects. This pattern wraps itself
around a request in specific execution points in which it can process,
pre-process, post-process and redirect requests. These interceptors can
also be stacked to form interceptor chains that can be executed
implicitly. The chaining is all about positioning in the configuration
file. The order of declaration is very important. These stacked
interceptor chains form a chain of separate, declaratively-deployable
services to an existing web application or framework without incurring
any changes to the main application or framework source code. This is a
powerful feature that can help developers and framework contributors
share and interact with their work.
</p>
<p>Interceptors are a great compliment to ColdBox plugins, in which now
they can be used alongside of them and implicitly add functionality to
a ColdBox application. Another important aspect to note is that
Interceptors have full access to a request's lifecycle and the
framework. Thus, they can get application settings, redirect control,
execute events, use the cache manager, get plugins, transform views,
adapt views for certain protocols and much more. Please read the full <a class="wiki" href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi/wiki/cbInterceptorsGuide">Interceptor's Guide</a> for an in-depth tutorial.

<p>
Below are just a few applications of ColdBox Interceptors:
</p>
<ul><li>Security

</li><li>AOP Interceptions
</li><li>Publisher/Consumer operations
</li><li>Implicit chain of events
</li><li>Content Appending or Pre-Pending
</li><li>View Manipulations
</li><li>Custom SES support
</li><li>Cache advices on insert and remove
</li><li>Much more...
</li></ul><h3 id="MuchmorethanInterceptors">Much more than Interceptors</h3>
<p>
However, we went a step further with interception points and created
the hooks necessary in order to implement an observer/observable
pattern into the entire interceptor service. Ok ok, what does this
mean? It means, that you are not restricted to the pre-defined
interception points that ColdBox provides, <strong>you can create your own</strong>
WOW! Really? Yes, you can very easily declare execution points via the
configuration file or register at runtime, create your interceptors
with the execution point you declared (Conventions baby!!) and then
just announce interceptions in your code via the interception API. The
power of conventions. However, not only can you intercept at an
execution point, but you can actually send a structure of intercepted
data right into the interceptor. You can use these custom interceptors
as a set of listeners waiting for broadcast information. You can even
create chains of listeners for the same message.
</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope that this overview gave you an insight into how powerful
ColdBox is for building your web applications. It is a new generation
framework based on conventions that will increase your productivity and
adaptability in a team environment. Welcome to the ColdBox Platform.
